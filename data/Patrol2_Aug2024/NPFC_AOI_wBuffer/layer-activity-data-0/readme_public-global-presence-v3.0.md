### Description
Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vesselâ€™s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as carriers. The activity layer displays a heatmap of vessel presence. The presence is determined by taking one position per day per vessel from the positions transmitted by the vessel's AIS.

Filters: vessel_type IN ('carrier', 'fishing') and  timestamp >= '2024-07-23T00:00:00.000Z' and timestamp <= '2024-08-24T00:00:00.000Z'
Group by: vessel_id
Temporal resolution: daily (data is grouped by vessel_id and summarized by day)
Spatial aggregation: true


### Columns

* Time Range: The data format depends on the temporal resolution, for monthly (YYYY-MM), for daily (YYYY-MM-DD), for yearly (YYYY) and for entire the date-range query param value.
* vessel_id: A unique vessel identity developed for internal use by Global Fishing Watch and API (Application Programming Interfaces) users, that combines available vessel identifiers such as name, callsign, and Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) in order to identify vessels that may not consistently transmit AIS, or the same identifiers on AIS, over time. .
* Vessel IDs: Number of different vessel ids.
* Entry timestamp: Timestamp when the vessel acceded to the region.
* Exit timestamp: Timestamp when the vessel exited of the region.
A unique vessel identity developed for internal use by Global Fishing Watch and API (Application Programming Interfaces) users, that combines available vessel identifiers such as name, callsign, and Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) in order to identify vessels that may not consistently transmit AIS, or the same identifiers on AIS, over time. .
* Vessel Presence Hours: hours that the vessel associated with this vessel_id was present in the grid cell over the selected time range
* Flag: Flag state (ISO3 value) for the vessel as determined by the first three digits (MID) of the MMSI number.
* Vessel Name: AIS reported name of the vessel.
* Gear Type: The vessel gear types estimated by GFW were developed by aggregating available vessel registry records, reported AIS identity information, and estimated classification using our machine learning algorithm. Detailed information can be found [here](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code-vessel-identity/).
* Vessel Type: Vessel types from GFW include fishing vessels, carrier vessels, and support vessels. The vessel classification for fishing vessel is estimated using known registry information in combination with a convolutional neural network used to estimate vessel class. The vessel classification for carrier vessels is estimated using a cumulation of known registry information, manual review, and vessel class. All support vessels in the vessel viewer are considered purse seine support vessels based on internal review.
* MMSI: MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) of the vessel, AIS identifier.
* IMO: AIS reported IMO (International Maritime Organization) of the vessel.
* Call Sign: also known as IRCS (International Radio Call Sign) of the vessel, as reported on AIS.
* First transmission date: first date when there is a position transmitted on AIS by the vessel.
* Last transmission date: last date when there is a position transmitted on AIS by the vessel.

## Data Versioning

The AIS data used by Global Fishing Watch are updated daily and periodically revised following occasional interruptions in our AIS feed.  Additionally, we are continuously working to improve our technology to most accurately classify and track vessels globally using AIS. Therefore, data downloaded from our map is subject to change over time. There may also be slight differences between data downloaded from the Global Fishing Watch map and the static datasets that are available on the data download page (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-fishing-effort). Every effort is made to ensure these data are as similar as possible, however the intention of the downloadable datasets are slightly different. The static datasets have been thoroughly reviewed and use a specific versioning in order to be reproducible for in-depth research. The data provided through the Global Fishing Watch map is generated using 4wings experimental technology. The map uses the latest versioning of our data available, along with any improvements identified in our algorithms, and is updated every single day. We will continue to improve our documentation on versioning of our different downloadable data, and will notify users of these updates.
